### About the Dataset

This dataset provides network traffic data for analyzing routing-based attacks in **Internet of Things (IoT) networks**, specifically targeting the **RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks)**. It was generated using the **Cooja simulator** and includes both **normal** and **attack scenarios**, covering four major attack types:

- **Black Hole Attack**  
- **Decreased Rank Attack**  
- **Version Number Attack**  
- **Hello Flooding Attack**  

The dataset consists of **24 features** and **48,024 samples**, capturing critical network parameters such as **packet transmission details, energy consumption, node rank, and geographical position**.

Designed for **machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS)**, this dataset aims to improve **classification accuracy** and **reduce false alarm rates**. By offering **balanced and enriched network traffic data**, it facilitates research in **detecting routing attacks** in constrained **IoT environments**.
